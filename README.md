- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Abarna-6 (codecracker2912@gmail.com)

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Full Stack Development, especially Backend Development. I am using technologies like Java8, Spring Boot, Microservices, Hibernate, Restful Web Services. Currently I are using Lambda Expression, Functional Interface, Date Time API's in our Credit and Debit card transaction processing system. Utilizing Spring Boot as a Web Application Framework with its defined annotations such as @Service @Repository @Component. Worked under Junit test cases with JACOCO code coverage as well. Apart from Java 8, I have also created login web page application using React JS. I have also worked under Restful Web Services as well. We are using PostGreSql database and using Postman for Database updation to be done. Having good exposure in Java 8 developed functional interfaces for Debit card transaction. We have also used Jenkins Build for continuous integration and Continuous Deployment (CI / CD) pipelines. Having good exposure in developing using application server such as Tomcat and JBOSS. Having exposure with Scripting languages such as HTML and CSS. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java Programming (Java 8 & Java 11) along with Data Structures, Problem Solving and Algorithms.
